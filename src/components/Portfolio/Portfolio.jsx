              <p>
                A few years ago I bought{" "}
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DQ2KGNK/">
                  outlets that are controlled using 433MHz radio signals
                  </a>
                  . Unfortunately, these devices required a specific remote to
                  transmit signals to turn the outlets on or off; losing the
                  remote would mean that I could not control the outlets.
                  Additionally, there was no way to control these devices
                  through the internet.
                </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to be able to control these devices on my local
                network, or better yet, using a voice assistant such as Alexa.
                  I bought a{" "}
                <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">
                  Raspberry Pi
                  </a>{" "}
                  and a{" "}
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076Q64MBQ/">
                  radio receiver/transmitter
                  </a>{" "}
                  set so that I could convert my outlets into a smart device.
                </p>
              <p>
                After{" "}
                <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RF-433-MHZ-Raspberry-Pi/">
                  reading the radio signals
                  </a>{" "}
                  from the remote and storing it into a file, I then built an{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/tingc10/radio">Express server</a>{" "}
                  that had a basic API interface to execute commands to transmit
                  the signal. To make calls to the server, I built a React based{" "}
                <a href="https://tingchen.me/radio-ui/">remote controller</a>.
                  I was then able to add new features such as a timer, which
                  then allowed me to turn my window AC unit into a smart device.
                  Finally, I built a custom Alexa skill and made my server
                  available via Ngrok so I could control the devices by voice.
                  With that I was able to turn my radio controlled devices into
                  a smart appliance ðŸŽ‰
